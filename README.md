# homeworkAI
a program that can do homework. 
finds answer that matches words in the question in the textbook or other document, works great with fill in the blanks questions.

Convert your textbooks to a text file, run the python file questions.py, and enter the filepath and the questions.
Needs NLTK.

not recommended to use for doing homework as you wont learn anything, although it has a reasonable accuracy. I only did this to learn about NLP
This does not work with math, or physics, or any subject that requires calculation. works for history, geography(maybe), and comprehension questions
